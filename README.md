# Pandas-Agent
This project provides an interactive, AI-driven data analysis assistant. It leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand user questions in Arabic, select the most relevant statistical datasets, generate and execute Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) code for data processing and visualization, and then explain the results in clear Arabic. The entire system is accessible via a user-friendly Gradio web interface, making complex data analysis intuitive for non-technical users.

Important :  Get your own Api from https://www.together.ai/ and replace it in the code to try it
